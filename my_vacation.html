    <h1>My Dream Vacation</h1>

    <p>If I could choose any place for a vacation, I would go to <strong>Monaco</strong>. 
    The country is known for its <em>luxury lifestyle</em>, <strong>Formula 1 Grand Prix</strong>, and of course, its amazing <em>cars</em>. 
    As a car enthusiast and former pro karting driver, visiting Monaco would be a dream come true!</p>
