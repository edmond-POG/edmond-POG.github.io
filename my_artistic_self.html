      <p id="description">I chose these words because they reflect my personality, drive, and approach to challenges. The background image features Buddy Shedeur, my favorite player, because I admire his style both on and off the field. He is known for his swag, fashion, and confident demeanor during games, and that sense of persona inspires me. I also enjoy expressing myself in a bold way; some might call it arrogance, but I see it as confidence and individuality. Like Shedeur, I aim to combine skill with style and show dedication in everything I do.</p>
