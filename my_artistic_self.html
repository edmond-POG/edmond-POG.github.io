        I chose these words because they reflect my personality, drive, and approach to challenges. 
        The background image features Buddy Shedeur, my favorite player, because I admire his style both on and off the field. 
        He is known for his swag, fashion, and confident demeanor during games, and that sense of persona inspires me. 
        I also enjoy expressing myself in a flashy and bold way; some might call it arrogance, but I see it as confidence and individuality. 
        Developing my own unique persona is an important part of who I am, whether in sports, school, or creative projects. 
        Like Shedeur, I aim to combine skill with style, showing dedication, ambition, and self-expression in everything I do.
